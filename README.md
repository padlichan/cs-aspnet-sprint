# ASP.NET Core Learning Project

This repository is a small project designed to practice building and testing an ASP.NET Core Web API while working with foundational features of the framework.
The project focuses on understanding key concepts like setting up the API and seeding the database using Entity Framework.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to:

- Understand and explain the problem that ASP.NET Core solves.
- Describe the structure of an ASP.NET Core application and how its components interact.
- Create a basic ASP.NET Core API using appropriate dependencies.
- Set up and handle GET, POST, DELETE, and PATCH endpoints in an ASP.NET Core application.
- Seed a database with initial data using Entity Framework Core.
